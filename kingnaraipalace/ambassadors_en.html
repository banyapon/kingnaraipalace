                Ban wichayen was built in the reign of king narai the great to serve as the residence of the French
                ambassador (Alexander, chevalier de Chaumont) who visited the king narai’s court in 1685 (2228 b.e.) and
                also used as the reception hall to welcome the french envoy (simon de la loubere and claud ceberet du
                boullay) who visited the kingdom of siam in 1687 (2230 b.e.) when the French diplomat departed,
                Constantine phaulkon, known as the thai nobel tite chao phraya wichayen, was assigned to look after the
                buildings the residence was mistakenly thought as phaulkon’s own residence by others and called it “ban
                wichayen”<br/><br/>
                The residence compound can be divided into 3 parts: west, central and east and can easily notice by the
                front gate of each part. The residence was found that the constructions in the central and the east
                parts are somewhat connected in term of function such as achapel and alarge 2 storied building. They are
                both solidly and securely constructed and on the perfect spot to accommodate and entertain the foreign
                ambassadors. a catholic chapel known as noter-dame de laurette could be used to perform religious
                ceremonies by the priests who accompanied the foreign diplomatic envoys. The most notable building is a
                catholic chapel with European chapel floor plan but decorated with traditional thai style nimbus shape
                window frames and door frames featuring the stucco of elongated petal lotus on the pillars.
                Some of the buildings are in a very European style especially the large 2 storied brick and mortar
                building situated in the east sied which featured the renaissance style windows and arched doorways
                which was very popular during that period the group of buildings in the west part have been the
                residential hall, banquet hall. Storage room and kitchen. Wichayen wife’s name is marai guyomar de pinha
                or known by the local people is toa thong keep ma “the legendary of the thai sweet recipes”
                <br/><br/>The fine arts department has acclaimed and registered this ancient site on the 2nd august 1936
