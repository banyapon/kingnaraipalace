                Pran khaek is located between para narai rachanivej and the official residence of ambassadors. It is not
                far from phra prang sam yod. In the former time, it functioned as asacred place of the Brahmanism. It
                consists of 3 brick parangs locat ng in a row arrangement, north-south. The one in the middle I s the
                biggest that is in between the 2 prangh in sma;;er size, all 3 prangs have only 1 entrance In the east
                while the other 3 entrance are fake. This ancient site is aged around the 15th Buddhist century. This is
                determined by the architectural style of the prang that is similar to pha-kho type of khmer art (During
                882-893 or 1425-1436 b.e.) the similarity is the way the two prangh were built of brick. The difference
                is that it was not coated with plaster but connected with gum (Sticky substance obtained from stems of
                trees). <br/><br/>The door was built of stone but the king narai the great in parall with the construction of a
                minor wihara in front of the prang. The entrance is in a sharp-curve. In addition, there is water
                container at the south of this prang. Later on, in 1961 and 1978 (2504 and 2521 b.e.) the fine arts
                deeperment worled on the excavation and renovation of the indian prang which is one of the most
                important ancient sites of lopburi province.<br/><br/>
                The fine arts department has acclaimed and registered this ancient site om the 2 nd august 1936.
