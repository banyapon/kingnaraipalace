        Wat phrasrirattana mahathat is a large deserted temple it covers an area of 20 rais or about 8 acres. The layout of the temple consists of a large prang in the middle of the temple functioning as the principal part, building and chedis that encircle the temple. According to the pattern of its architectures and sculptures existing in the temple, it is assumed that it must habe been built since the 18-19th Buddhist century before the kingdom of Ayutthaya was established. Evidence had shown that when Ayutthaya was in tits centennial, somdet phra maha chakkraphat had ordered the renovation of this temple. Later in the reign of king narai the great, the prayer hall (Viharn), the peristyle and the chedis were added. The temple was renovated again during the reign of king boromakot.
        Important monuments in the temple complex include a massive prang at the center of the complex surrounded with the peristyle. All the prangs were built with laterite. The main one is 30.7m tall and flanked with smaller prangs in the north and south sides. The man one is 30.7m tall and flanked with smaller prangs in the north and south sides. The east side is attached with portico. The other building worth mentioning is the royal chapel (Viharn gau hong) which situated in front of the main parng. Built in the reign of king narai the great, this large hall features traditional thai art style nimbus shape door, the lostus-petal shaped window and surrounde with low wall. In front of this hall lies the robe changing pavilion, a place where the king changes his robes before performing religious ceremony inside the royal chapel. This huge monstery was constantly renovated, restored and expanded over the time as can be seen in chedis, small sized prangs as well as halls around the complex.
        The fine arts department has acclaimed and pegistered this ancient site on the 2nd august 1936.
