                Prang sam yod is located on the earth moind adjacent to phra karn shrine. There are 3 pangngs located in
                a row arrangement with an access connecting together. This ancient site represents the bayon style of
                art that is aged around the 18 th Buddhist century. The prangs were built of laterite, sandstone, and
                decotated with stucco in beautiful style. At the entrance where there once was alintel, it remains only
                the pole at the doorframe, which was carved in the pattern of ascetic sitting with his knees up. The
                ascetic is in the roun kaew arc. This is a particular style of the bayon type of khmer art.
                There is a base where an image once stood still remain at the middle prang. The roof that is built of
                wood was painted with red color in flowering design. In front of the prang in the east, there is a brick
                wihara. Presumably, this wihara should be built during the reign of king narai the great because the
                doors and windows are bent into the shape of curve this is a particular architectural style of this
                period inside the brick wihara, there is sandstone Buddha image in marnvichal pattern. This marnvichal
                Buddha image is still in good condition. It is a particular style of the early Ayutthaya period of art,
                aged around the 20th Buddhist century.<br/<br/>
                It is assumed that the purpose of building prang sam yod was to serve the Mahayana of Buddhism. The
                middle prang hoses a Buddha image with a naga over the head. The prang in the right houses the stone
                bodhisativa (Avalokithesavara) in bayon style. The prang in the left houses the figure of
                pratchata-paramita or panya baramisakit of the bodhisativa phra
                The fine arts department has acclaimed and registered this ancient site on the 2nd august 1936.
